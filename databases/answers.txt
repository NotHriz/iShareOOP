Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. In Java, you use method overriding to achieve this.

An example of polymorphism is when a method is overridden in a subclass. The method call is resolved at runtime based on the actual object.

Use interfaces when you want to define a contract that multiple classes can implement. Use abstract classes when you want to provide some shared code.

Abstract classes can have method implementations, but interfaces can't (unless they’re default methods in Java 8+). That’s a key difference.

Great question! Polymorphism makes code more maintainable and reusable by allowing one interface to be used for a general class of actions.

A NullPointerException occurs when you try to use an object reference that hasn't been initialized. Always check for null before using objects.
